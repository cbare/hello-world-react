Hello World React

A toy app to learn me some [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

To get started, I did this helpful tutorial on [setting up a React dev environment with Yarn, webpack, and Babel](https://scotch.io/tutorials/setup-a-react-environment-using-webpack-and-babel) by Joy Warugu.

## Uses
 * [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
 * [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy)
 * [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
 * [lodash](https://lodash.com/)
 * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
 * [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
 * [Raven integration with Sentry.io](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/javascript/integrations/react/)
